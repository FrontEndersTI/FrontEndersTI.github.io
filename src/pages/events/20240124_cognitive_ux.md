In everyday life, our brain adopts mental shortcuts to effectively decode the complexity of the world around us. These strategies have ensured the survival of our species, but not without introducing some side effects: cognitive biases.

During this presentation, we will explore some of the fundamental concepts of psychology and cognitive neuroscience. We will analyze how their application can influence, both positively and negatively, the creation of more impactful and persuasive user experiences.
