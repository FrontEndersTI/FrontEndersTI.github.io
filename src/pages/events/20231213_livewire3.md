Tools like Vue and React are extremely powerful, but the complexity they add to a full-stack developer's workflow is insane. Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that makes building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.

This time we will be guests of the IT area of the Cantonale Hospital Organization EOC, located at Via Lugano 4B, Bellinzona - on the fifth floor.
